Selena Gomez, 25, recently flew home to Texas, where she grew up, to spend Thanksgiving with her friends and family. She was filmed by a friend, slurping spaghetti on Nov. 21, in an Instagram video [watch below]. So, is Dani, 23, not far behind? — Well, while it’s unknown where the Stern will spend turkey day, it may be a good idea for him to jet off to Texas. As you may know, Selena’s family aren’t exactly his biggest fans after watching Jelena’s past relationship woes. Sel ended up broken hearted after they split in late 2015, when Justin had a bit of a reckless period in his life. Therefore, Selena isn’t the only one Justin needs to completely win over; although he’s pretty much marked Sel off his list.

North Korea has called the US criticism of North Korea’s human right record a “blatant challenge and intolerable insult”.
The North Korean state media article — which appeared in the Workers’ Party newspaper, Rondong Sinmum — also warned the US not to “style itself as a ‘human rights judge’”, describing the US as a “land where racial discrimination, gun-related crimes and all other social crimes prevail”.
<br>
“The U.S. persistent anti-DPRK "human rights" racket based on false information is a blatant challenge and intolerable insult to the dignified DPRK, the best cradle of genuine life for the popular masses in the world. It is also the last-ditch effort to check our advance.
<br>
It was the biggest mistake for the Trump group to calculate that their tough sanctions and nuclear threats would make the DPRK step back.”
<br>
Though the article may have been written in advance, it was published on the day US President Donald Trump addressed the South Korean National Assembly where he issued a direct warning to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, declaring that continued nuclear provocation “would be a fatal miscalculation”

Still inside the Forbidden City, US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watched a traditional Peking Opera performance alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan.

Unlike his trips to Japan and South Korea, which were far more policy focused off the bat, Trump's first hours in China have been spent enjoying the country's culture and history. Peking Opera dates back to the 18th century, analysts said earlier Xi would be

## Trump and Xi watch Peking Opera performance
<br>
First lady Melania Trump has arrived in Beijing, the third and final leg of her trip to Asia with President Donald Trump, who will continue on to Vietnam and the Philippines.
<br>
Since starting her trip to Asia on Sunday, Trump has spoken publicly once during the trip. But she's embraced the role of a gracious guest, accompanying the President to his speeches, state visits and formal dinners, and sitting in the front row for both of his joint press conference appearances.
<br>
Trump has a busy schedule for the remainder of her trip. On Thursday, the Trumps will participate in a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, then she will attend a spousal program. Later in the day, she will meet and greet Americans at the US Embassy alongside the President, then attend a state dinner and cultural performance. Friday, Trump will have some time to play the role of tourist, visiting a zoo to interact with giant pandas and tour the Great Wall of China before returning to the United States.

Activist Kim Seong-eun, who heads the Caleb Mission church in Cheonan, South Korea, told CNN on Wednesday 10 North Korean refugees, including a three-year-old boy, were detained in Shenyang in northeast China on Saturday, and called him from jail.
"Recently there has been an increase in arrests of North Koreans in China," he said, adding dozens of defectors had been arrested and deported in recent months.

South Korea’s Ministry of Unification told CNN it has yet to confirm Kim's claims. The Ministry said it is doing “all it can diplomatically with the related nations to prevent the deportation of the defectors in whatever circumstances”.
